A few years later, in 1950, he applied information theory to analyze human predictive abilityâ€”in other words, the entropy of the human language model.

Recall that Zipf's law states that a word's rank (from the most common word at rank 1 on down) to its frequency is approximately a constant, i.e., $r \\cdot f = k$. Equivalently, we can divide both sides by the total number of tokens $N$ to get $r \\cdot P_r = c$, where $c = k/N$ and $P_r = f/N$ is the _relative frequency_ of word $r$.\n",
